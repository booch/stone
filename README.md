The Stone Programming Language
==============================

Stone is a multi-paradigm programming language. It combines the ideas of object-oriented,
functional, and actor-based languages. It is a typed language, with immutability by default.

This is a *very* new language, but I've been thinking about the design of the language for
quite some time. The design documents can be found in [/docs/design].

The language is described in Markdown, with code blocks showing example code.
The code blocks also show the expected result of evaluating the code.
This is also used as the language specification â€”
all the example code is checked to ensure that it evaluates to the expected result.
These can be found in [docs/specs].
