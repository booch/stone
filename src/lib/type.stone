* A type might have a `cardinality` that we can ask for
	* Tells how many possible values the type has
	* It might be `Infinity` though
	* `Boolean.cardinality` would be `2`
	* `Null.cardinality` would be `1`
	* `Nothing.cardinality` would be `0`
	* It's hard to determine the cardinality of anything other than a `Type.Enum`.
	* Cardinality of a `Type.Union` (union type) would be the sum of the cardinalities
